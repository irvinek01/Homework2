Description: A Web Portfolio, features a series of CSS designs I learned from Week 1, its main feature is being a responsive by the size of the screen, next is the on hover designs and last, a little bit knowledge about the student who made it. Special thank you for Mr. John and Maam Janani, to my whole class. I appreciate the tireless understanding and unending support
